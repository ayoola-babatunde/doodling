# doodling
A simple drawing program. I wanted to be able to doodle with my graphic tablet on a semi-transparent surface while a video or something plays in the background.

Originally forked from [techinologic](https://github.com/techinologic/python-tkinter-mouse-events). Modified by adding different pen colours, a clear screen button, and an opacity option. 

#### Possible future updates
+ slider for pen thickness
+ RGB colour options
